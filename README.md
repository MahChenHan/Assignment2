# PlanetCommerce

Our website name is 'PlanetCommerce'. Our website will be equipped with categories and subcategories for ease of navigation, as well as promoting the top sellers recently. A contact page will also be implemented, as well as minigames that not only compliment the website, but also rewards the users, be it discounts or special offers. 
 
## Design Process
 
* **Customers**
    * Customers will be able to view a large variety of products, ranging from appliances to clothing.
    * Customers would be able to earn rewards with certain purchases made.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
